I\uc1\u8217\'92m going to go over several topics from his presentation and how they relate to computer forensics and also state a few of my opinions on the subject. The U.S. Secret Service takes part in many ways to ensure the safety of the United States and the citizens apart of it. Agent David Booth said their main mission is to safeguard the nation\uc1\u8217\'92s financial infrastructure and payment systems to help preserve the integrity of our economy and to help protect national leaders, visiting heads of the state, national security events, and also }{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}government designated sites.}{\s32\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s32\sl240\slmult1\itap0{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab Before delving in, U.S. Secret Service Agent David Booth gave us a little background of his agenda over the last decade. What was very interesting was the fact that being in the Secret Service involved being rite next to public figures. T}{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}hey protect the president, vice president, immediate family, former presidents, and cabinet level officials; former presidents and ladies get protection forever. Agent }{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}Booth stated that for four years he was by President Bush\uc1\u8217\'92s side protecting him and his daughters, was assigned to Mitt Romney for six months, and even assigned to the president of Indonesia for another six months. I thought this was very cool, being able to help out and meet with such political figures would be quite exhilarating. Agent Booth then explained how the U.S. Secret Service started. He stated that back on April 14th, 1865 the service began in relation to the assassination of President Lincoln. Also in 1865 one third of the money circulating was counterfeit because of the Confederation. The Secret Service officially went into action when it was signed in on July 5th, 1865 later that year. Agent Booth said \uc1\u8220\'93The Secret Service likes to brag that they started the FBI\uc1\u8221\'94, which I thought was pretty funny.}{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s32\sl240\slmult1\itap0{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab The Secret Service\uc1\u8217\'92s main area of interest is in the protection of key people and second are crimes. Several of these crimes include: counterfeit money which is their bread and butter, financial crimes, and computer related crimes. Computer related crimes have been soaring and Agent Booth said they evolved to combat these issues along the way, dedicating more and more time towards the subject. For them their are many different areas related to computer crimes which involve \uc1\u8220\'93carding\uc1\u8221\'94 and \uc1\u8220\'93skimming\uc1\u8221\'94 through the use of credit cards. Also critical systems protection which involved beefing up systems, networks, and increasing firewalls for major events, say if the president were visiting the Pepsi Center, to avoid intrusions and unwanted attacks. And their involvement in the Internet, battling key-loggers, malaware, and viruses. As you can tell this is a pretty important part. If you use a computer today their are tons of scammers and hackers employing malaware, bots, phishing for people to steal personal identifiable information, and social engineering people to deceive them. You can feel the Internet becoming more bloated!}{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s32\sl240\slmult1\itap0{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab Because of all the dangers lurking rite around the corner on many electronic devices they set up a program to help, called the Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program(ECSAP), which began in 1987. The ECSAP has twelve agencies across the United States with most of their members specifically being trained in computer forensics involving three levels of training. Today agent Booth stated their are well over 1600 trained agents partaking in the USSS field all over the globe and approximately 180 new agents are being equipped with this knowledge annually. A good thing since many criminals are becoming smarter and stealthier. With more people being trained in the forensics field we are adequately able to handle and prevent attacks form hackers. With the knowledge we learn we can be on the same level as them. Besides the ECSAP, their are many other programs to help agents to become more familiar with computer related crimes. A few of these are their NITRO course for network intrusion, Linux and Mac OSX forensics, cell phone forensics, and point of sales systems. Though, the backbone of their training is the ECSAP-CF course for forensic examination of digital storage devices. In fact agent Booth said he spends most of his time in finding images on computers, hard drives, and digital media devices relating to counterfeiting. He said this is not an easy task either, finding them is very tedious work.}{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s32\sl240\slmult1\itap0{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab The work the U.S. Secret Service is involved in is beneficial in the protection of our country. Without their help much of our privacy and security would be more vulnerable and exploitable. Even though the rate at which computer crimes are happening, having certain organizations involved provide ease of mind. Being in the computer science field myself the information agent Booth presented to us is very eye-opening. I am very interested in the idea of stopping criminals and hackers. The work they do and the challenges they are presented with in cyber security is of particular interest to me and is one of the main reasons I\uc1\u8217\'92m in this field. I only hope that one day I\uc1\u8217\'92ll be able to return the favor.}{\s32\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}}
