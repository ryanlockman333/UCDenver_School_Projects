	The windows registry first began with Windows 3.1. Its main purpose was to store information on the configuration of the COM-based components. It was initially designed by IBM for a presentational manager but was adopted by Microsoft through a joint application. Before the registry some of the same information was stored in .INI files for availability. The main purpose for the registry is to store application settings, driver settings, and service information in a logical repository; it even helps in allowing multiple users on the same machine interface. With the registry comes an editing program, such as Regedit, to help with manipulating registry keys, setting Access Control List permissions, fixing errors, and finding information relating to a user(NTUSER). Also SAM, SECURITY, and SOFTWARE are just a few specific files to discover valuable information on a given system.
	As with much software since its start, the Windows registry has had quite the journey. Many features have been added along the way, such as atomic updates, in-file mapping, and the support for 32-bit and 64-bit applications. The registry was originally for 16-bit applications but over the years higher bits to store more information have been needed. Also to aid in a more human readable form .Reg files were created around the time of Windows 2000/NT to aid in the importing and exporting of certain portions of the registry.
	All in all the Windows registry is a crucial part of the system interface. Since other operating systems like Linux and Mac OSX do not have registry-like support, Windows has an advantage over this area of architecture and it will continue to advance overtime. Knowing how to operate the registry is a main part in computer forensics of Windows machines and is key to discovering much system information. Without it things would not be as straight-forward.
