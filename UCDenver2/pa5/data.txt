    A concordance is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work,
with their immediate contexts. Because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating
a concordance in the pre-computer era, only works of special importance, such as the Vedas,[1]
Bible, Qur'an or the works of Shakespeare and other classical Latin and Greek authors,[2] had
concordances prepared for them.
