The Dirstributed Database
 -Different physical locations
 -belong logically to one system
 What constitutes the whole system?
    -Planned Redundencey

      -
systme design - complex, hard to document
system implementation/maintanance - coordianate ready, execute on a schedual
system interations with people

      +
applications that are naturally distributed
increased availability/reliablity
local control for sharing
 -client/server architecture
improved performance
 -seperated data into managable bits

Functions of DBMS
    -access to remote
    -transmit between sites
    -track data distribuion
    -track replication
    -execution of data structures at multiple sites
    -delete which copy to access
    -maintain integrity among replicas
    -recover form disasters(site or network failures)

To specify a horizontal fragment - a subset of rows of entity
    f1 <--- 0``<bool> (R(|><|<bool> S))

to specify verticle fragment - a subset of columns
    f2 <--- PieSymbol<columns, col> (R)

mixed Fragment - some of the rows some of the cols
    f3 <--- PieSymbol<col1,col2,...>(O``<bool>(TABLE))

Fragmentation Schema - all parts that constitute the database
DBNAME <--- {f1 |><|<bool> f2 |><|<bool> f3 |><|......fx}
