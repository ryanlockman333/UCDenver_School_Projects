Algorithm:

Create a constant for KILO.
One kilometre ='s 0.621 miles.
Create our input, output, and mile variables for storing our data.
Use cout and cin to input user data.
Create our formula (KILO * miles) to complete our conversion.
Re-use cout to output our answer.
Check our values for correct output.
